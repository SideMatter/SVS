# Ridge Wallet - SideMatter

## Prepare the wallet for skinning

Wipe it down with a microfiber cleaning cloth, included in your dbrand order.

## Rough Cut

Place the item on the back of the 3m Paper. Draw a line, about one inch around the sides, then cut with either a pair of scissors or an xacto knife.

## Apply Skin

Peel off the back of the 3M paper and place the wallet face down on the exposed skin.

## Trimming

Using a sharp xacto knife, trim around the edges of the wallet, being careful to not remove skin under the face of the wallet.

## Melting the skin

After step 4, pick up your wallet, and either trim up the edges if theres excess, and wipe the edges 10-15 times with a microfiber cleaning cloth.
